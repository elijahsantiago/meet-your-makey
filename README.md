## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of this workshop is to teach students how to interact with technology in a physical, tactile way. By utilizing the Makey Makey device, participants will design and play their own instruments using everyday objects. This workshop helps bridge the gap between abstract programming concepts and real-world applications, making learning programming fun and engaging. Through this hands-on experience, students will gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and input/output systems in a creative context.

This workshop has participants create their own instruments and experiment with sound through physical interactions with their designs.

## :bulb: Project Information
* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> Intermediate

## :page_with_curl: Project Description
This project utilizes the Makey Makey device and the Godot game engine to create an interactive musical instrument. Participants will build their own instrument by connecting everyday objects to the Makey Makey and program it using Godot. The instrument will trigger sounds and interact with the player through key mappings, volume control, and recording features. Through this process, participants will understand how to implement algorithms in a physical, tangible way.
